    <p>Hi! I'm Diego, a detail-oriented and solution-driven professional with a background in client-facing roles and a growing portfolio of software development projects. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UMGC, and I've since been honing my skills in full-stack development, with experience in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more.
        <br><br>Before transitioning into tech, I worked for several years in the homebuilding industry, where I managed customer relationships, scheduled complex workflows, handled documentation, and coordinated with cross-functional teams. That experience taught me the value of communication, persistence, and staying organized under pressure, qualities I now bring to every line of code I write and every project I build.
        <br><br>Whether I’m developing applications, learning new frameworks, or collaborating with others, I enjoy solving real-world problems and building tools that make things simpler, more intuitive, or just more beautiful. I’m currently building out my portfolio and looking for opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects and grow as a developer.
        Thanks for visiting!
