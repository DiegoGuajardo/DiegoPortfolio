                <p><strong>🎓 Computer Science Graduate:</strong><br> I earned my <strong>Bachelor’s in Computer Science</strong> from UMGC, where I built a solid foundation in Java, Python, and web development. I developed projects that improved my understanding of algorithms, object-oriented programming, and software design.</p>

                <p><strong>🏡 Sales at Tri Pointe Homes:</strong><br> I began as a <strong>Sales Assistant</strong>, where I supported New Home Advisors by greeting and qualifying potential buyers, managing meetings, updating clients on their home progress, maintaining model home presentation, and handling data entry and reporting in Salesforce CRM. After being promoted to <strong>New Home Advisor</strong>, I took on full ownership of the client experience, from initial tours through to closing. Without a supporting assistant, I handled everything from generating contracts and updating CRM records to coordinating with design, construction, finance, and title teams. I consistently exceeded sales goals while maintaining high customer satisfaction throughout the process.</p>
